    - Use image in /public
        - https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/assets
            - Nuxt won't serve files in the assets/ directory at a static URL like /assets/my-file.png. If you need a static URL, use the public/ directory.
        - https://image.nuxt.com/get-started/configuration#dir
            - For ipxStatic provider, if images weren't crawled during generation (unreachable modals, pages or dynamic runtime size), changing dir from public causes 404 errors.
            - For some providers (like vercel), using a directory other than public/ for assets is not supported since resizing happens at runtime (instead of build/generate time) and source fetched from the public/ directory (deployment URL)
